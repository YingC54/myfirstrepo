    <h2>Background</h2>
<!-- using a name tag to move the webpage downwards to find the section with philosophy tag -->
    <p>There is a saying when studying literature that "Context is Everything", and Ying adapts this <a href="#philosophy">philosophy</a> when planning UX research studies.</p>
    
    <p>Ying combines that insight with knowledge on people's interactions with systems and databases from her studies on Libraries and Information to dig into user's interaction.</p>

<h2>Hobbies</h2>

<h2>Hopes and Dreams</h2>
<p>Ying hopes to get a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siberian_Husky#/media/File:Husky_L.jpg">husky</a> one day and have fun with her dog.</p>

<h2><a name="philosophy">Philosophy</a></h2>
<p>Having a core philosophy, such as adapting context to the research scope, helps Ying to tackle research projects more realistically and take constraints into consideration when analyzing the data.</p>
